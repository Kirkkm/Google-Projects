'''
This is the last part of the lab, where you will have to write a Python script named health_check.py that will run
in the background monitoring some of your system statistics: CPU usage, disk space, available memory and name resolution.
Moreover, this Python script should send an email if there are problems, such as:

    Report an error if CPU usage is over 80%
    Report an error if available disk space is lower than 20%
    Report an error if available memory is less than 500MB
    Report an error if the hostname "localhost" cannot be resolved to "127.0.0.1"

# variables for checking the
cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()
diskspace = psutil.disk_usage()
free_memory = psutil.swap_memory().free
